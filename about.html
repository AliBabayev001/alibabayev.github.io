            <h2>Welcome!</h2>
            <p>
              I'm Ali Babayev, a first-year Computer Science student at ADA
              University. I have a strong enthusiasm for computer science and a
              deep drive to learn and grow in the field. I enjoy taking on
              challenging problems, exploring new technologies, and applying
              practical skills to real projects. My goal is to build a solid
              foundation in algorithms, systems, and software development as I
              pursue a long-term career in computing.
            </p>

            <h3>My Journey</h3>
            <p>
              My interest in computing is personal, my grandfather was a
              well-known computer scientist in his time, programming automation
              systems for several plants in his city. Beyond his computational
              expertise, he was also a dedicated math teacher who profoundly
              shaped my mathematical foundation. Growing up, he acquainted me
              with the elegance and power of mathematics, instilling a deep
              appreciation for the subject. My passion for mathematics is
              reflected in my academic achievements: I scored 100.0 in
              Mathematics from SEC (DIM) and 150.0 from "Blok". I further
              demonstrated my mathematical prowess by achieving a 5 on the AP
              Calculus BC exam, scoring 800 in Mathematics on the SAT, and
              earning 3 international mathematics olympiad medals (SASMO, AMO).
              These accomplishments depict my profound love for mathematics and
              its applications. Growing up hearing my grandfather's stories and
              seeing the tangible impact of his work in both computing and
              mathematics inspired me to follow a similar path. His achievements
              motivated me to explore both fields deeply and shaped my decision
              to study Computer Science at ADA University.

            <h3>What I Do</h3>
            <p>
              As a student, I concentrate rigorously on my Computer Science
              studies, exploring topics related to algorithms, systems, and
              software engineering. Mathematics forms the theoretical backbone
              of my technical work, and I actively engage with advanced
              mathematics to deepen my understanding of computational theory and
              optimization. Beyond the classroom, I pursue hobbies that sharpen
              my thinking and creativity: chess, which develops strategic
              reasoning and pattern recognition; advanced mathematics, which
              challenges me to think abstractly and solve complex problems; and
              perfumery, which trains attention to detail and fosters creativity
              in a different medium. Together, these pursuits complement my
              technical learning and help me grow as a well-rounded student who
              bridges the worlds of mathematics, computer science, and creative
              exploration.
